Leaguerunner - PHP software to run an ultimate league

This is a redesign and rewrite of a piece of code formerly known as the "OCUA
Engine".  It runs the Ottawa-Carleton Ultimate Association's summer, fall, and
winter indoor leagues, handling over 350 teams and 3500 players per year.
Unfortunately, the original OCUA Engine was written as organically-grown Perl
CGI scripts, and isn't easily maintainable.  This codebase is a rework of that
initial design.

Prerequisites:
	- Apache webserver with mod_php, version 4.x or newer
	- Smarty templating system, version 2.x or newer (see http://smarty.php.net/)
	- MySQL database
	- a lot of patience
