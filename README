Leaguerunner - PHP software to run an ultimate league

This is a redesign and rewrite of a piece of code formerly known as the "OCUA
Engine".  It runs the Ottawa-Carleton Ultimate Association's summer, fall, and
winter indoor leagues, handling over 350 teams and 4300 players per year.

Prerequisites:
	- Apache webserver with mod_php, version 4.x or newer
	- Perl, for the email reporting scripts
	- MySQL database
	- a lot of patience
	
If you're very impatient and want to set things up without reading the full
documentation (that is, when it actually exists...), here's how to get things
running.

First, you'll need these prerequisites installed according to their
instructions:
	Apache  1.3.x
	PHP     4.2.x
	PEAR    1.4.x
	MySQL   3.23.x
	Perl    5.6.x  (optional)

If you don't know where to find them, ask your system administrator.  If you
_are_ your system administrator and still don't know, ask Google.


Now, to install the database, you'll need to create the database and set up a
MySQL user.  This is done by default as part of setup/db/mysql_schema.sql if
you run it as:
  mysql -uroot -p < setup/db/mysql_schema.sql
  
however, you probably don't want the default database name, username and
password.  To change it before running that line, edit the file and change the
lines:
  DROP database IF EXISTS leaguerunner;
  CREATE database leaguerunner;
  use leaguerunner;

  grant all on leaguerunner.* to leaguerunner@localhost identified by 'password';

to use whatever DB name you'd like wherever you see 'leaguerunner', and
whatever username you'd like in place of 'leaguerunner@localhost'.  The
password should also be changed from 'password' to something less guessable.

If you already have a user and database, just delete those lines.

Then, set up the leaguerunner database tables with:

mysql -uroot -p < setup/db/mysql_schema.sql
mysql -uroot -p < setup/db/mysql_initialdata.sql

(using your own db user if you've already created one.
