The Main TODO List

Basic Install Needs:
	- need install instructions

Docs:	
	- need better user docs
	- developer docs
	- code is mostly uncommented =(

Reimplementation:
	- send email:
		+ when account is created
		+ to captain when player requests to join
		+ to player, when captain requests them

Redesign:
	- Clean up database schema
	- (DONE) de-templateify this code; Smarty is too much of a pain in the ass.

New Features:
	- start using the 'year' column for leagues, to allow multiple leagues
	  to co-exist for sequential seasons.
	- add test for adding teams to multiple leagues.  Basically, as long as
	  (year, season) for all leagues are different, it's OK.
	- volunteer info
	- integrate Tony's score-reminder code
	- better score approval for coordinators, esp. handling of defaults
	- carpool arrangements
	- players looking for teams / teams looking for players
	- add "Leagues Coordinated" to person view page.

	- handle playoffs.  For now, just allow scheduling of rounds based on Q
	  (quarters), S (semis), F (finals).  Eventually want to be able to
	  schedule a ladder that's automatically filled in as results are
	  provided.

	- fix the rankings so that three-way ties are dealt with properly.
	  Possibly use a modified Elo system (see soccer rankings for details).
	
	- rather than selecting a field and a start time, coordinators should
	  be able to select a "game slot" (for lack of a better term) that
	  knows start/end times and field location.  For example, a league
	  might have assigned to it:
	  	"Sod 12, Summer, Monday, 6:45pm - dark"
		"Sod 12, Summer, Monday, 6:30pm - 7:40pm"
		"Sod 12, Summer, Monday, 7:45pm - dark"
	  or
	  	"Carleton Fieldhouse 1, Winter, Thursday, 8:45pm - 10:10pm"
		"Carleton Fieldhouse 1, Winter, Thursday, 10:15pm - 11:40pm"
	  or whatever.  Then there's no chance of selecting the wrong time,
	  timecaps are readily visible on the schedule, and overlaps and
	  double-booking can easily be seen.

	- automatic generation of round-robin schedule (3 game split tier, or
	  7-game full tier)
	
	- use Mike Reade's spirit system

Field Management:
    Add more attributes to fields, auto-generate field websites from DB on
    periodic basis.
    
    Fields should have the following attributes viewable by all:
        - (DONE) full name of field
        - (DONE) field code (a unique shorthand notation for the field, consisting of
          3 letters and 2 numbers (ie: UPI01, SOD10, LYL01, RIV03)
        - location info
            - (DONE) region (east, west, south, north/gatineau)
            - street address
            - (DONE) URL to location map (where the field is)

                + very limited, carpool required
                + limited, carpool recommended
                + average
                + ample
            - parking instructions
                - text field explaining where to park (also, indicate on map if
                  possible)
                - list alternate parking locations and/or special restrictions
                  (ie: illegal parking frequently ticketed, no parking on
                  game-day for the Renegades, etc)
                - 
        - field permits

            - open, closed, newly located, 
        - Condition log
            - reported conditions based on game result submissions.
              This may be something we want to make public, so players know
              what to expect:
                - date of observation
                - firmness (very soft, soft, average, hard, like cement)
                - grass cover (barren, poor, average, good, excellent)
                - overall quality (poor, average, good, excellent)
                - notes on new potholes, hazards, changes, etc.
        - Area designation
            - ultimate field, soccer field, football field, baseball outfield,
              multiuse field, cricket pitch, open greenspace
        - size (length and width)
        - lighting availability
        - ownership
            - city of ottawa, city of gatineau, NCC, private, OCUA
        - contact info for owner/managert
            - name, address, phone, email, URL
        - URL of scanned contract

        - availability.  For each day of week:
            - start and end time ranges
                (i)Morning
                (ii)Afternoon
                (iii)Evening
                (i)Before 6:30pm
                (ii)6:30-8:30pm
                (iii)After 8:30pm
        - administrative notes

Bugs:
	- (DONE) player selecting "join team" rather than "change status" gets
	  told that they don't have permission.  This should be fixed so that
	  they get the changestatus page if they're already on the roster in
	  some
	  capacity.
