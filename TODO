The Main TODO List

Basic Install Needs:
	- need install instructions

Reimplementation:
	- send email:
		+ when account is created
		+ to captain when player requests to join
		+ to player, when captain requests them

Redesign:
	- Clean up database schema
	- de-templateify this code; Smarty is too much of a pain in the ass.

New Features:

	  to co-exist for sequential seasons.

	- volunteer info
	- integrate Tony's score-reminder code
	- better field management
