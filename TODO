The Main TODO List

Docs:	
	- need better user docs
	- developer docs
	- code is mostly uncommented =(

Code Cleanups and Refactoring:
	- Clean up database schema

Known Bugs:
	- fix the rankings so that three-way ties are dealt with properly.
	  Possibly use the elo rating system as a tiebreaker instead?
	- ensure that all email sent is rfc-compliant and not missing any
	  headers
	- login page should have focus on username field
	- login page tab order should move from username -> password
	

New Features:

 1) Playoff Support
	- handle playoffs.  For now, just allow scheduling of rounds based on Q
	  (quarters), S (semis), F (finals).  Eventually want to be able to
	  schedule a ladder that's automatically filled in as results are
	  provided.

 2) League History
	- start using the 'year' column for leagues, to allow multiple leagues
	  to co-exist for sequential seasons.
	- also requires multiple team rosters (see below)
	- add start/end dates 
	
 3) Multi-roster support
 	- allow teams to create multiple rosters if they so desire
	- to do this, extend the teamroster table to have a roster ID, and add
	  a roster table with (team,rostername)
	- team also gets an extra field, current_roster, which points to the
	  roster ID of the current roster.
	- leagueteams table also gets a 'roster' field, so (team, roster)
	  defines the players in that league
	- may want to lock old rosters at the end of the season and auto-create
	  new ones
	
 4) Automatic email
	- score-reminder code for notifying captains of missing scores.
	- send email:
		+ when account is created
		+ to captain when player requests to join
		+ to player, when captain requests them
	- Better handling of automatic mailing-list generation (for Mailman)
	  from Leaguerunner.

 5) Carpool code
	- carpool arrangements
	- should allow cross-team carpooling

 6) Player-team matchups
	- players looking for teams / teams looking for players

 7) Scheduling changes 
 	- implement pyramid ladder (see other doc)
	- automatic generation of round-robin schedule (3 game split tier, or
	  7-game full tier).  This depends on the abovementioned "game slot"
	  support to allow automatic selection of fields.
	
 8) Field Management
 	- extra per-field attributes: for player view
        	- GPS coordinates and/or mapquest search criteria
		- public transit info
		    - specific routes
		    - OCT stop IDs (can use it to link directly to schedule info)
		- parking
		    - parking availability:
			+ very limited, carpool required
			+ limited, carpool recommended
			+ average
			+ ample
		    - parking instructions
			- text field explaining where to park (also, indicate on map if
			  possible)
			- list alternate parking locations and/or special restrictions
			  (ie: illegal parking frequently ticketed, no parking on
			  game-day for the Renegades, etc)
		- field permits
		    - URL of scanned field permit
		- special instructions
		    - field setup notes, notification of hazards
		    
	- extra data for administrators:
		- field status
		    - open, closed, newly located, 
		- Condition log
		    - reported conditions based on game result submissions.
		      This may be something we want to make public, so players know
		      what to expect:
			- date of observation
			- firmness (very soft, soft, average, hard, like cement)
			- grass cover (barren, poor, average, good, excellent)
			- overall quality (poor, average, good, excellent)
			- notes on new potholes, hazards, changes, etc.
		- Area designation
		    - ultimate field, soccer field, football field, baseball outfield,
		      multiuse field, cricket pitch, open greenspace
		- size (length and width)
		- lighting availability
		- ownership
		    - city of ottawa, city of gatineau, NCC, private, OCUA
		- contact info for owner/managert
		    - name, address, phone, email, URL
		- URL of scanned contract
		- Year acquired or use started
		- administrative notes
