The Main TODO List

Basic Install Needs:
	- need install instructions

Docs:	
	- check in Mack's user instructions

Reimplementation:
	- send email:
		+ when account is created
		+ to captain when player requests to join
		+ to player, when captain requests them

Redesign:
	- Clean up database schema
	- de-templateify this code; Smarty is too much of a pain in the ass.

New Features:
	- start using the 'year' column for leagues, to allow multiple leagues
	  to co-exist for sequential seasons.
	- add test for adding teams to multiple leagues.  Basically, as long as
	  (year, season) for all leagues are different, it's OK.
	- volunteer info
	- integrate Tony's score-reminder code
	- better score approval for coordinators, esp. handling of defaults
	- carpool arrangements
	- players looking for teams / teams looking for players
	- add "Leagues Coordinated" to person view page.

Field Management:
    Add more attributes to fields, auto-generate field websites from DB on
    periodic basis.
    
    Fields should have the following attributes viewable by all:

          3 letters and 2 numbers (ie: UPI01, SOD10, LYL01, RIV03)
