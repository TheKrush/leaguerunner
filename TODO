The Main TODO List

Basic Install Needs:
	- need install instructions

Docs:	
	- need better user docs
	- developer docs
	- code is mostly uncommented =(

Code Cleanups and Refactoring:
	- Clean up database schema
	- rewrite of permissions code so that it isn't so crusty.
	- (DONE) remove the 'alias' section, as it's been decided that OCUA doesn't
	  want it and I didn't want to write it in the first place anyway. 

New Features:
	- (DONE) add "Leagues Coordinated" to person view page.
	
	- (DONE) set full name to be unchangeable by the user after account approval,
	  but allow admins to access it
	- start using the 'year' column for leagues, to allow multiple leagues
	  to co-exist for sequential seasons.
	- add test for adding teams to multiple leagues.  Basically, as long as
	  (year, season) for all leagues are different, it's OK.
	- volunteer info
	- write score-reminder code for notifying captains of missing scores.
	- better score approval for coordinators, esp. handling of defaults
	- carpool arrangements
	- players looking for teams / teams looking for players
	- handle playoffs.  For now, just allow scheduling of rounds based on Q
	  (quarters), S (semis), F (finals).  Eventually want to be able to
	  schedule a ladder that's automatically filled in as results are
	  provided.
	- fix the rankings so that three-way ties are dealt with properly.
	  Possibly use the elo rating system as a tiebreaker instead?
	- (DONE) rather than selecting a field and a start time, coordinators should
	  be able to select a "game slot" (for lack of a better term) that
	  knows start/end times and field location.  For example, a league
	  might have assigned to it:
	  	"Sod 12, Summer, Monday, 6:45pm - dark"
		"Sod 12, Summer, Monday, 6:30pm - 7:40pm"
		"Sod 12, Summer, Monday, 7:45pm - dark"
	  or
	  	"Carleton Fieldhouse 1, Winter, Thursday, 8:45pm - 10:10pm"
		"Carleton Fieldhouse 1, Winter, Thursday, 10:15pm - 11:40pm"
	  or whatever.  Then there's no chance of selecting the wrong time,
	  timecaps are readily visible on the schedule, and overlaps and
	  double-booking can easily be seen.

	- automatic generation of round-robin schedule (3 game split tier, or
	  7-game full tier).  This depends on the abovementioned "game slot"
	  support to allow automatic selection of fields.
	
	- use Mike Reade's spirit system
	
	- send email:
		+ when account is created
		+ to captain when player requests to join
		+ to player, when captain requests them
		
	- integrate survey questions into database, rather than having them
	  hardcoded in an HTML file

	- set up data serialization for user edit, so that all changes can be
	  logged in a data field for approval/rejection by an admin.  This is
	  wanted to prevent people from changing their account info to
	  something bogus.

	- (DONE) automatic mailing-list generation (for Mailman) from Leaguerunner.
	  We would like to have:
	     ${season}-captains@lists.ocua.ca
	     	- goes to all captains and assistants of teams in that season
	     ${night}-${season}-captains@lists.ocua.ca
	        - to all captains/ass of teams on that night and season
	     tier-${tier}-${night}-${season}-captains@lists.ocua.ca
	        - cap/ass for a tier
	     ${season}-coordinators@lists.ocua.ca
	     	- all coordinators for a season
	  All lists are to be archived and moderated.

Field Management:
    Add more attributes to fields, auto-generate field websites from DB on
    periodic basis.
    
    Field sites should have the following attributes viewable by all:
        - GPS coordinates and/or mapquest search criteria
        - public transit info
            - specific routes
            - OCT stop IDs (can use it to link directly to schedule info)
        - parking
            - parking availability:
                + very limited, carpool required
                + limited, carpool recommended
                + average
                + ample
            - parking instructions
                - text field explaining where to park (also, indicate on map if
                  possible)
                - list alternate parking locations and/or special restrictions
                  (ie: illegal parking frequently ticketed, no parking on
                  game-day for the Renegades, etc)
                - 
        - field permits
            - URL of scanned field permit
        - special instructions
            - field setup notes, notification of hazards

    And private data for administrators & volunteers:
        - field status
            - open, closed, newly located, 
        - Condition log
            - reported conditions based on game result submissions.
              This may be something we want to make public, so players know
              what to expect:
                - date of observation
                - firmness (very soft, soft, average, hard, like cement)
                - grass cover (barren, poor, average, good, excellent)
                - overall quality (poor, average, good, excellent)
                - notes on new potholes, hazards, changes, etc.
        - Area designation
            - ultimate field, soccer field, football field, baseball outfield,
              multiuse field, cricket pitch, open greenspace
        - size (length and width)

        - Year acquired or use started
        - availability.  For each day of week:
            - start and end time ranges
