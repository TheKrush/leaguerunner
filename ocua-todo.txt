OCUA TODO items (not in any particular order)

1) Search players by member number

2) Boilerplate message for rejecting due to invalid data

3) Simplification of permissions required to view account info

4) Ability for coordinators to hide schedules from players until they are final
   and should be published.  Possible workflow:
   	- schedule
	- add games using wizard
	- tweak schedule
	- publish

5) Increased ability for field preferences
	- have a second "home" region, or possibly:
	- rank regions in descending order

6) Get rid of our hacky YYYYSNNN format member number and switch to a straight
   integer.

7) Use email address as login ID like every other site on earth.

DONE 8) Allow deletion of leagues

9) Multiple contact email addresses in LR profile

10) Fix "Field Closed" stuff so that it actually works

11) Add creation date to accounts

12) manage mailing list subscriptions within LR.

13) Automatic sunset-based timecaps in LR.
