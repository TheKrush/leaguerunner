 	<h1>OCUA Spirit Rating Guidelines</h1>
    <p>
	These guidelines are designed to help teams determine spirit rating.
	</p>
	<p>
	Get your team to vote/decide on a spirit rating, and then submit your score 
	and spirit rating via the online system.  Few teams are going to nicely 
	fit into the slots below, so use this chart as a guideline only.
