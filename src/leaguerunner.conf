## 
## Leaguerunner configuration file.
##
## This file is parsed by both PHP and Perl, and so should contain ONLY lines
## of the format 
##   $variable = 'value';
## or Bad Things will happen.  More robust parsing may be added in the future,
## but don't hold your breath.

## Database configuration.  Format is
## 	database://username:password@hostname/database_name
$DB_URL   = 'mysql://leaguerunner:ocuaweb@localhost/leaguerunner';

## Base URL.
## This should be the directory containing Leaguerunner.  Don't 
## add a trailing slash.
$BASE_URL = 'http://localhost/leaguerunner';
