<blockquote>
<p>
I am a member of the Ottawa Carleton Ultimate Association (OCUA), and the

this consent, and as such do hereby agree to be responsible for the conduct
and actions of said dog and do hereby release and discharge OCUA from any and
all responsibilities, liabilities and complaints arising from the conduct and
actions of my said dog in or about any properties used by OCUA, including the
SOD Farm site on Spratt Rd. and the UPI property on Manotick Station Rd. 
</p>
<p>
In respect of said dog, I agree to comply with the following rules:
<ol>
  <li>that I will be in control of my dog at all times, and will ensure that my
  dog is leashed and restrained while games are in progress.

  <li>that I will pick up (poop &amp; scoop) any and all fecal matter left by my
  dog at any of the said properties, and remove said waste and any bags
  containing said waste from the properties when I leave.

  <li>that I will not under any circumstances put plastic bags in the porta
  potties or in the bushes, long grass, or elsewhere on or about the said
  properties. 
</ol>
</p>
