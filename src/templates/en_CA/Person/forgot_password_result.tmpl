<h1>Password Reset</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>
	The password for the user matching the criteria you've entered has been
	reset to a randomly generated password.  The new password has been mailed
	to that user's email address.  No, we won't tell you what that email 
	address or user's name are -- if it's you, you'll know soon enough.
	<br />
	If you don't receive an email within a few hours, you may not have
	remembered your information correctly, or the system may be encountering
	problems.
</p>
